      <h2 class="h2">Documentary Project #1 (In Development)</h2>
      <p>
        A feature-length documentary project centered on firsthand accounts during the American Civil War. The film draws from personal diaries and primary documents to reconstruct daily life inside a city under sustained siege.
<br /><br />
• Status: Research & Transcription<br />
• Format: Feature-length documentary<br />
• Source Material: Archival diaries, correspondence, military records
      </p>
      <p>
        When complete, I plan to return my analysis and transcription back to the library that currently houses the material.

    <section class="panel" aria-label="Documentary project 2">
      <h2 class="h2">Documentary Project #2 (In Development)</h2>
      <p>
        A second documentary project currently in early development. This one is still in the “wide research” stage:
        collecting sources, mapping themes, and pressure-testing the structure before narrowing down the core story.
