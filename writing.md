          <p>
            Values-driven institutions often look humane on the surface: careful language,
            collaborative norms, and a shared sense of mission. But when roles, authority,
            and decision-making stay unfinished, responsibility doesn’t disappear.
          </p>
          <p>
            It relocates into ambiguity, informal expectations, and the people most willing
            to carry the load. Over time, “being reliable” becomes a job requirement. Exhaustion
            becomes normal. And the system keeps functioning precisely because someone keeps compensating.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>When Good Intentions Fail</strong> names the pattern clearly—without drama—and gives readers
            a way to recognize where the burden went, why it landed there, and how to stop mistaking personal
            strain for personal failure.

          <h3 class="h3">Excerpt</h3>
          <p>
            Most institutions begin with language—mission statements, values decks, guiding principles.
            Early on, those words attract people who care and create a sense of shared purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            But eventually, values have to become structure: roles, authority, process, and protection.
            When that translation never fully happens, values start doing work they were never designed to do.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>“Values can guide decisions. They cannot carry them.”</em>
