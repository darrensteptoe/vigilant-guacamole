      <p class="cardText"><strong>When Good Intentions Fail</strong><br><em>How Institutions Quietly Transfer Burden</em></p>
      <p class="cardText"><em>Coming soon.</em></p>

      <div class="subhead">Back cover</div>
      <p class="cardText">Values-driven institutions often look humane on the surface: careful language, collaborative norms, and a shared sense of mission. But when roles, authority, and decision-making stay unfinished, responsibility doesn’t disappear.</p>
      <p class="cardText">It relocates into ambiguity, informal expectations, and the people most willing to carry the load. Over time, “being reliable” becomes a job requirement. Exhaustion becomes normal. And the system keeps functioning precisely because someone keeps compensating.</p>
      <p class="cardText"><strong>When Good Intentions Fail</strong> names the pattern clearly—without drama—and gives readers a way to recognize where the burden went, why it landed there, and how to stop mistaking personal strain for personal failure.</p>

      <div class="subhead">Excerpt</div>
      <p class="cardText">Most institutions begin with language—mission statements, values decks, guiding principles. Early on, those words attract people who care and create a sense of shared purpose.</p>
      <p class="cardText">But eventually, values have to become structure: roles, authority, process, and protection. When that translation never fully happens, values start doing work they were never designed to do.</p>
      <p class="cardText"><em>“Values can guide decisions. They cannot carry them.”</em></p>

      <p class="cardText"><em>“You are a very good writer. I’m impressed by how effective your sentences are—enough words to make an interesting point, but not overly flowery.”</em><br><span class="muted">— Griffith</span></p>
